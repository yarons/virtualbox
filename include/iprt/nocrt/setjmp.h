/*
 * With Visual C++ (or clang in Visual C++ mode) on Windows, the _setjmp call is
 * treated as an intrinsic/builtin and tranformed (lowered in clang terms) to a
 * _setjmp3, _setjmp or _setjmpex call depending on the architecture (x86, amd64,
 * and arm/arm64 respectively). The latter two gets an implicit frame pointer
 * argument added, whereas _setjmp3 takes zero or more extra restore parameters.
 *
 * We must use the underscored variant w/o any nocrt_ prefix for the compiler to
 * recognize the setjmp call as an intrinsic.
 *
 * The longjmp function is also an instrinsic, but it doesn't get extra arguments
 * added, but it makes the compiler aware what're doing (esp. for asan builds).
 * We *MUST* use RT_NOEXCEPT_EX(false) on it, or the asan build doesn't fully
 * recognize it and won't emit the necessary unwind stuff (x86 tstNoCrt-1/Jmp4).
