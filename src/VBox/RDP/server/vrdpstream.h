/* The VRDPStream object is a stream for updates, which are generated
 * by the output thread:
 *   - orders;
 *   - bitmaps;
 *   - pointers.
 *
 * Updates are accumulated and are sent in a single network packet
 * when either enough data accumulated or a timer flush happens.
 *
 * The stream is the layer between VRDP (VRDPTP) and SECURE (VRDPPacket).
 *
 * The stream takes care of composition of network packets for both
 * rdp4 and rdp5 (without sec, mcs, iso) RDP packets.
 *
 * The stream is operated as directly accessible memory.
 *
 * VRDPTP is upper level that uses VRDP stream to store
 * RDP commands data.
 *
 * SECURE is lower level used for transmitting composed RDP data.
 * SECURE (and lower levels), actually VRDPPacket, should be able to
 * scatter data to be transmitted. Data is passed as array of (ptr,size) pairs.
 *
